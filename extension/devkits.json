      "description": "This evaluation kit carries a PSOC&#8482; E84 EPC2 MCU (PSE846GPS2DBZC4A) on a SODIMM based detachable SOM board connected to the base-board. The MCU SOM also has 128 Mb QSPI flash, 1 Gb Octal flash, 128 Mb Octal RAM, PSOC&#8482; 4000T as CAPSENSE&#8482; co-processor and on-board AIROC&#8482; Wi-Fi & Bluetooth&#174; combo (CYW55513IUBG). <br><br>The base-board has M.2 interface connectors for interfacing external radio modules based on AIROC&#8482 Wi-Fi & Bluetooth&#174; combos and external memory interfaces. The base-board features an on-board programmer/debugger(KitProg3), ETM/JTAG/SWD debug headers, custom display capacitive touch panel connector, R-Pi compatible MIPI-DSI and MIPI-DSI custom display, Analog and PDM microphones, Headphone connector, Speaker, USB Host Type-A and USB device Type-C connectors, RJ45 Ethernet connector, M.2 (B-key) memory interface and M.2 (E-key) radio interface, Infineon’s Shield2Go interface, Mikroelektronika's mikroBUS compatible headers, 6-Axis IMU sensor, 3-axis Magnetometer, microSD cardholder, CAPSENSE&#8482; buttons and slider, user LEDs and user buttons. The MCU power domain supports following operating voltages - 2.7 V, 3.3 V, 4.2 V and the peripheral power domain supports operating voltages - 1.8 V and 3.3 V."
