# ModusToolbox Assistant README

This extension is an assistant for using ModusToolbox with the Visual Studio Code.

## Features
TBD

## Requirements

This extension requires ModusToolbox version 3.2 or later to be installed.  It does not work
with ModusToolbox 2.x, 3.0, or 3.1.  

This extension works best if the 'clangd' extension is installed to manage Intellisense.  The
default Microsoft support for 'C/C++' intellisense does not work as well.
