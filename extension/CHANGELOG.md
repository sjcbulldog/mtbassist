# Change Log

### 1.2.14
  Updated to find the firmware loader with the programming tools since they are decoupled
  from ModusToolbox with the stand alone programming tools.

### 1.2.13
  Cleaned up some small bugs in finding documentation

### 1.2.12
  Improved the firmware upgrade process for development kits

### 1.2.11
  Updated to provide more progress information while loading an application.
  Eliminated duplicate calls to 'make get_app_info'
  Updated the build target at the top level for multi-core projects to run make at the top level.

### 1.2.10
  Minor bug fixes

### 1.2.9
  Fixed a bug where opening a document, also opened an external dictionary page.
  Checked to be sure a new project was not being created in an existing project directory.
  Now, if the current directory in VS Code does not contain a Makefile, the project will default to the current directory.
  If the current directory does contain a Makefile, then the directory choice is left to the project creator.

### 1.2.8
  Fixed a bug with the quick program task/quick link not being available

### 1.2.7
  Fixed bug with problems in the problems window not taking you to the source code with the
  problem.

### 1.2.5
  Fixed naming convention for the commands that turn on/off the display of a ModusToolbox
  code example read me.  These are now 'ModusToolbox Assistant: Turn On Code Example Readme'
  and 'ModusToolbox Assistant: Turn Off Code Example Readme'.

### 1.2.4
  Fixed a bug where the build tasks would overbuild on both linux and mac os.

### 1.2.3
  Added support for the experimental NINJA build mode.

### 1.2.2
  Update create project so that if you are not currently in a ModusToolbox directory, the new
  project will be created in the current location.

### 1.2.1
  Added comamnd (mtbassist.mtbAddTasks) to explicitly add any tasks to the tasksk file that
  this extension would like to have in place.

### 1.2.0
Updated the quick launch window on the left to provide more options and allow the user
to perform operations on a per project as well as a per application basis.

Detected a MTB worksapce file earlier in the load process and reloaded based on the workspace
file early in the process.

Deferred the loading of the manifest data from github until after it has been determined that
there was a valid ModusToolbox application loaded.

Added the ability to query for any enabled early access pack and show any documentation found in
the early access pack via the documentation tree viewer.

### 1.1.11
Directly open the workspace file when creating a new project if it exists.

### 1.1.10
Updated the output when device kits are not connected to the machine so they are not reported
as an error.

### 1.1.9
Fixed a bug when the VSCode extension was launching a ModusToolbox tool that was based on
electron.  VSCode sets the ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE value which interferes with the tool being
launched.  This value is filtered out of the environment prior to launching any ModusToolbox
tools.

### 1.1.8
Added the quick link panel on the left to make some common tasks easier to launch.

### 1.1.7
Fixed bug with some tightly managed environments where starting the ModusToolbox shell via the
terminal command caused error "/tmp not found" and locked up other ModusToolbox commands.  Note
you should close any ModusToolbox terminals in any VS Code sessions and restart VS Code to get the
updated (and fixed) behavior.

### 1.1.6
Added command to turn off showing code example README file.

### 1.1.5
Make the firmware update message stand out more so that it is not missed.
Fix a bug when searching for asset documentation with directories that do not have read/search permission.

### 1.1.4
Fixed a bug with the recent ModusToolbox applications page

### 1.1.3
Fixed bug with welcome page not being displayed under some conditions

### 1.1.2
Added a notification about kits being out of date

### 1.1.1
Added a message when the welcome page is displayed because of out of date kits.

### 1.1.0
Added the ability to detect ModusToolbox supported kits attached to the local machine and display
the list of kits.  If the firmware for these kits are out of date, provide an option to update the
firmware.

### 1.0.34
Fixed the intellisense data file (compile_commands.json) that is malformed out of ModusToolbox
3.1 after each build so that intellisense continues to work.

### 1.0.33

### 1.0.32

If you are using clangd (recommended) for Intellisense, the extension can configure clangd
to provide the best possible Intellisense experience.

Added the ability to switch between projects for intellisense when in a multiproject
application.  Right clicking on the status indicator (MTB) in the bottom right will
bring up a selection of projects that exist in the current application.

ModusToolbox Documentation command on the right click (context) menu can now find the 
documentation for the specific item under the cursor.

If a ModusToolbox application is loaded and assets are missing, the user is prompted 
to run 'make getlibs' to download any missing assets.  This can happen if an application
is shared via git and another developer has added assets via the library manager. This
will happen if you are working with others on an application and someone else adds an asset
to the project and you pull the changes.  The requirement for the asset will be present
via a .mtb file, but the actual asset will be missing.

Added a brief overview of the features of this extension in the extension welcome page.

### 1.0.31
Updated to filter out documetation that is hidden below a component that is not
defined and therefore should not be shown.

### 1.0.30
Updated to fix bug with older ModusToolbox 2.x projects where getlibs was run every
time the project was loaded.

### 1.0.29
Put a work around where the C language server finds a symbol in the wrong
version of an asset.  This leads to the extension saying the symbols is not
in an asset, when it really is.

### 1.0.28
Fixed a bug in the WSL support

### 1.0.27
Updated to find documentation when running in WSL from windows

### 1.0.26
Updated manifest parsing to be more compatible with manifest requirements

### 1.0.24
Added support for ModusToolbox 3.1

### 1.0.23
Detect when a project has been moved and can no longer be built.  In this case
run 'make getlibs' to refresh the project.  Created a status bar item to show
the status of the current open folder or workspace with respect to ModusToolbox.

### 1.0.22
Fixed a defect with multi-core projects not updating correctly

### 1.0.21
Reduced when the ModusToolbox Assistant log window is displayed

Reworded some of the text in the ModusToolbox view to make intent more obvious

When loading a ModusToolbox project but no build support is available, 
run 'make getlibs' to bring in the required buidl support.  This basically
eliminates the need for the "import from disk" command.

### 1.0.20
Cleaned up how the tools are displayed in the ModusToolbox view.

### 1.0.19
Fixed bug with recent projects list not being updated

### 1.0.18
Fixed a bug with retreiving the extension version number

### 1.0.17
Added the ability to detect ModusToolbox application without build support
Added the Run 'make getlibs' command

### 1.0.16
Added the import from local directory command (mtbImportDiskProject)

### 1.0.15
Fixed a bug with newlines on Mac OS

### 1.0.14
Added in the display of the README.md file if it exists in the current application.

### 1.0.13
Added in the documentation of the Import command to try and make it more clear what the
command does and how it is used.

### 1.0.11
Fixed issues with multi-core projects.  Added in a warning screen if ModusToolbox 3.0 or later
is not installed.

### 1.0.9
Fixed issues with Mac OS and Linux display

### 1.0.8
Added Shift + Ctrl + F1 lookup for symbols documentation


### 1.0.6
Initial release of the ModusToolbox Assistant
