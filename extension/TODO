Priorities
----------
- Automatically run the 'make vscode' if the .vscode directory is not present
- If a user name has spaces, get alternate location, details below
- What to do if a project requires and EAP but it is not selected
- LLVM installation
- Lots of testing
  o Windows
  o Linux
  o Mac OS

Known Bugs
----------
- Thoroughly check out what BSPs are available with and without LCS.
- Figure out the interaction of operating mode and EAP
- Selecting code examples based on capabilities has bugs, look at the Control C3 BSPs, look at Edge and Hello World (not PSOC Edge Hello World)
