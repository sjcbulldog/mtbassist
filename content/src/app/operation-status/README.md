# Operation Status Component

## Overview

The `OperationStatusComponent` is a modern, sleek Angular component that displays the status of ongoing operations in the MTBAssist application. It provides real-time feedback to users about long-running processes with a clean, responsive interface.

## Features

- **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive interface with theme support (light/dark)
- **Real-time Updates**: Displays operation progress with scrollable status messages
- **Activity Indicator**: Animated spinner to show ongoing activity during operations
- **Close Button**: Shows a close button when operations complete for user dismissal
- **Auto-scroll**: Automatically scrolls to show the latest status messages
- **Backdrop**: Semi-transparent backdrop with blur effect for focus
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## Usage

The component is automatically integrated into the main app and responds to events from the `BackendService`:

### Starting an Operation
```typescript
this.backendService.startOperation.next('Operation Title');
```

### Adding Status Lines
```typescript
this.backendService.addStatusLine.next('Status message...');
```

### Finishing an Operation
```typescript
this.backendService.finishOperation.next('Operation Title');
```

## Updated Behavior

As of the latest update, the component behavior has changed:

1. **During Operation**: Shows the operation title, activity spinner, and accumulates status messages
2. **Operation Complete**: When `finishOperation` fires:
   - The spinner is replaced with a close button (X icon)
   - A "Operation completed." message is added to the status list
   - The component remains visible until the user clicks the close button
3. **User Dismissal**: Clicking the close button hides the component and clears all status data

## Component Structure

### Input Properties
- `themeType`: `ThemeType` - Controls the visual theme ('dark' or 'light')

### Key Features
- **Auto-show**: Automatically shows when `startOperation` fires
- **Manual dismiss**: Remains visible after `finishOperation` until user clicks close button
- **Status accumulation**: Collects all status lines during the operation
- **Auto-scroll**: Automatically scrolls to show the latest messages
- **Theme-aware**: Adapts styling based on the current theme
- **User control**: Users can close the dialog when operations complete

## Styling

The component uses CSS custom properties for theming and includes:
- Smooth animations for show/hide transitions
- Custom scrollbar styling
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Backdrop blur effect for modern appearance

## Integration

The component is integrated at the application root level (similar to password overlay) and automatically manages its visibility based on backend service events.

## Testing

A test component is available (`OperationStatusTestComponent`) that provides buttons to:
- Start a test operation
- Add sample status lines  
- Finish the operation (shows close button)
- Run full automated test sequence

This allows for easy testing and demonstration of the component's functionality, including the new close button behavior.
